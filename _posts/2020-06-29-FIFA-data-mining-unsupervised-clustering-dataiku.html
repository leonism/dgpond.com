<h3 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h3>
<p>If there&#39;s one thing similar about an interesting dataset and a good rerun football&#39;s match on TV, is that they&#39;re both doing pretty excellent job at keeping everyone&#39;s safe at home during this time of the pandemic. And in all honesty, I&#39;m not a data-scientist, nor a dev guru. I just recently got myself exposed to  <strong>Machine Learning, Data Mining</strong>  and  <strong>Artificial Intelligent</strong>  in general, while doing them in both  <strong>Dataiku</strong> and  <strong>Python (Pandas, NumPy and SciKit</strong> libraries<strong>)</strong>, somewhere a little over then 3 months period of time. And without any further ado, here&#39;s my take to the FIFA conundrum&#39;s challenge.</p>

<h3 id="2-dataflow">2. Dataflow</h3>
<p>And since the challenge is not to  <strong>&#39;predict&#39;</strong>  any variables, rather to &#39;<strong>group&#39;</strong> or &#39;<strong>cluster&#39;</strong>  the existing dataset from the player&#39;s skillsets, in reflect to their  <strong>wages rate</strong>. Here&#39;s what my current flow would look like, and don&#39;t bother much on the 2 additional datasets, as they&#39;re merely exported from the existing model, so that I may explore them further later on. And to follow along, here&#39;s the link to download the dataset in my 
<a href="https://github.com/leonism/dataiku-FIFA/blob/master/uploads/Conundrum_13_Data/Conundrum_13_Data.csv">Github repository</a>.</p>

<h3 id="3-prepare-recipes">3. Prepare Recipes</h3>
<p>And here&#39;s how I go about on the prepare recipes, nothing out of the ordinary. Just converting <strong><em>categorical</em></strong> to <strong><em>numerical</em></strong> values, through the <strong><em>one-hot encoding</em></strong> and filling up the &#39;<strong><em>NaN</em></strong>&#39; with median values, while grouping them to have better clarity, if ever the need occur for me to go back and revise anything again for future reference.</p>

<p class="aligncenter"><img data-src="/img/posts/fifa-dataiku/prepare-recipe.jpg" src="/img/posts/fifa-dataiku/prepare-recipe.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="prepare recipe" style="cursor: pointer;"></p>


<h3 id="4-data-modeling-training">4. Data Modeling &amp; Training</h3>
<p>While on the  <strong>modeling</strong>  and  <strong>training</strong>  steps, I choose the &#39;<strong><em>Interactive Clustering</em></strong>&#39; machine-learning algorithm, which in returned, delivered me a sufficient scoring value. As a side note, Dataiku provide you with various Machine Learning Algorithm according to your prediction methods requirement. Be it for  <strong>Supervised Learning</strong>  (develop predictive model based on both input and output data) and <strong>Unsupervised Learning (</strong>group and interpret data based only on input data). And for the article alone, will be utilizing the later version of Unsupervised Learning for data mining/clustering.</p>

<p class="aligncenter"><img data-src="/img/posts/fifa-dataiku/model-results.png" src="/img/posts/fifa-dataiku/model-results.png" class="img-fluid" alt="dataiku-data-modeling" style="cursor: pointer;"></p>

<h3 id="5-data-clustering">5. Data Clustering</h3>
<p>On to the clustering variables name, I simply identified them in the grading manner, starting from <strong>&#39;<em>Grading A</em>&#39;</strong>, as the most top-knot performer, all the way down to the least performing one marked with <strong>&#39;<em>Grading E</em>&#39;</strong>.</p>

<p class="aligncenter"><img data-src="/img/posts/fifa-dataiku/grading-classification3.jpg" src="/img/posts/fifa-dataiku/grading-classification3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="dataiku-grading-classification" style="cursor: pointer;"></p>

<h3 id="6-cluster-plot">6. Cluster Plot</h3>
<p>And here&#39;s how my cluster plot would look like, obviously the better the grade, the least volume of players getting included in them.</p>
<p><strong>Acceleration x Wage</strong></p>
<p class="aligncenter"><img data-src="/img/posts/fifa-dataiku/acc-wages.png" src="/img/posts/fifa-dataiku/acc-wages.png" alt="dataiku-Acceleration-Wage" class="img-fluid" style="cursor: pointer;"></p>

<p><strong>Sliding Tackle x Wage</strong></p>

<h3 id="7-grading-variables">7. Grading Variables</h3>
<p>And for sure, those who sit at the <strong>Grading A</strong> level would stand above the average threshold measurements (though, that&#39;s not always the case with other included variables, which I&#39;m about to show down below).</p>
<p class="aligncenter"><img data-src="/img/posts/fifa-dataiku/variable-significant.jpg" src="/img/posts/fifa-dataiku/variable-significant.jpg" alt="variable-significant" class="img-fluid" style="cursor: pointer;"></p>

<h3 id="8-values-proposition">8. Values Proposition</h3>
<p>And coming back again to the initial question, <code>&quot;Creating a flow that outputs a value proposition in term of the wages&quot;</code>. I think I didn&#39;t include the players name and their nationalities in my modeling for a couple of reasons. In my opinions, those two variables are just way too subjective to get included. In a sense, you could be a top-knot player, regardless of what your &#39;Names&#39; would sound like, and of course your &#39;Nationalities&#39;.</p>

<p>So I&#39;ve done the DSS flow diagram, while the followings are my list of &#39;value proposition&#39; that contributed of being one &#39;Grading-A&#39; player in the field.</p>

<h3 id="9-top-5-values-proposition">9. Top 5 Values Proposition</h3>
<p class="aligncenter"><img data-src="/img/posts/fifa-dataiku/values-by-distribution.png" src="/img/posts/fifa-dataiku/values-by-distribution.png" alt="values-by-distribution" class="img-fluid" style="cursor: pointer;"></p>

<h3 id="10-top-5-values-proposition-by-distribution">10. Top 5 Values Proposition By Distribution</h3>
<p class="aligncenter"><img data-src="/img/posts/fifa-dataiku/values-by-distribution-grading.png" src="/img/posts/fifa-dataiku/values-by-distribution-grading.png" alt="values-by-distribution-grading" class="img-fluid" style="cursor: pointer;"></p>

<h3 id="11-correlation-matrix">11. Correlation Matrix</h3>
<p>The very first correlation analysis consists of plotting the <em>Correlation matrix</em> for numerical variables. For each couple of numerical variables, this computes the &quot;strength&quot; of the correlation (called the Pearson coefficient):</p>
<ul>
<li>1.0 means a perfect correlation</li>
<li>0.0 means no correlation</li>
<li>-1.0 means a perfect &quot;inverse&quot; correlation</li>
</ul>
<p>Since it does not really make sense to print this correlation plot for hundred of variables, we are restricting it to the first 50 numerical variables of the dataset.</p>

<p>Been enjoying exploring this dataset for sure, and certainly it was fun doing it, stays safe everyone and leave a thumbs-up if you like the article and found this useful. 😊</p>
